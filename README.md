# ReflectoLearn

## Project Overview

This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** to significantly **improve the efficiency and accuracy of fitting X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) data** for determining thin film parameters.

## Future Plans

Key future developments include:

* **Model Improvement:** Seek and implement improved **physical models** for simulation and better **ML models/architectures** for fitting to boost performance and robustness.
* **Simulation Accuracy:** Enhance XRR simulation accuracy, crucial for generating realistic ML training data and validating results (focusing on factors like roughness and density).
* **ML Algorithm & Workflow:** Refine ML fitting algorithms, optimize training, and develop a more user-friendly analysis workflow.
* **Code Optimization:** Continue code refactoring for improved readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
